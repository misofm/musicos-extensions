# `release_cover_art`

Cover art for a `musicos::release::Release`: an album-level cover plus
optional per-track overrides, stored as one `ReleaseCoverArt` record under a
dynamic field on the release and written through its cap-gated `uid_mut`.
Cover art is presentation, not objective recording data, so it lives on the
release rather than the recording. The `CoverArt` value type comes from the
independently versioned [`misofm/cover-art`](https://github.com/misofm/cover-art)
package.

## What it stores

- Key: `ExtensionKey()` — a unit struct local to this package.
- Value: one `ReleaseCoverArt { cover: Option<CoverArt>, track_covers:
  PerTrack<Option<CoverArt>> }`. The overrides are one slot per track,
  aligned to the tracklist by construction and sized when the record is first
  attached; the tracklist is fixed at release creation, so they stay aligned.
  A track's effective cover resolves to its override if set, otherwise the
  album cover. The record is attached by the first set and is never removed;
  a clear empties the slot.

## API

Writes require the release's `&ReleaseAdminCap` and go through
`release::uid_mut(cap)`, which aborts `release::EUnauthorized` on a
mismatched cap before any stored-state check. Index validation precedes the
cap check. Views are permissionless.

| Function | Description | Aborts |
|---|---|---|
| `set_cover(rel, cap, art)` | Sets or replaces the album cover, attaching the record on first use; setting the value already held neither writes nor emits | none |
| `clear_cover(rel, cap)` | Removes the album cover; overrides are untouched; silent when absent | none |
| `set_track_cover(rel, cap, i, art)` | Sets or replaces track `i`'s override, attaching the record on first use; equal set is silent | `ETrackIndexOutOfBounds` (2) |
| `clear_track_cover(rel, cap, i)` | Removes track `i`'s override so it falls back to the album cover; silent when absent | `ETrackIndexOutOfBounds` (2) |
| `has_cover_art(rel)` | Whether the record is attached | none |
| `cover(rel)` | The album cover, `&Option<CoverArt>` | `ENoCoverArt` (1) |
| `track_cover(rel, i)` | Track `i`'s effective cover | `ETrackIndexOutOfBounds` (2), `ENoCoverArt` (1) |

## Events

Events are monomorphic and carry what an event-only indexer would otherwise
have to look up: the release, the track index on per-track writes, and the
blob IDs of the new value on a set.

| Event | Fields | BCS bytes |
|---|---|---|
| `ReleaseCoverArtSetEvent` | `release_id: address`, `still_blob_id: u256`, `animated_blob_id: Option<u256>` | 65 (no animation) or 97 |
| `ReleaseCoverArtClearedEvent` | `release_id: address` | 32 |
| `ReleaseTrackCoverArtSetEvent` | `release_id: address`, `track_index: u64`, `still_blob_id: u256`, `animated_blob_id: Option<u256>` | 73 (no animation) or 105 |
| `ReleaseTrackCoverArtClearedEvent` | `release_id: address`, `track_index: u64` | 40 |

Cover art is always unencrypted: `cover_art::new` rejects encrypted blobs.
An equal set and an absent clear emit nothing, so every event is a real
state transition.

## Errors

| Code | Constant | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ENoCoverArt` | `cover` or `track_cover` with no record attached |
| 2 | `ETrackIndexOutOfBounds` | A track index at or past the tracklist length |
